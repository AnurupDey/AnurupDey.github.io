        <h1><u>LINKS</u></h1>
		<h1>Text Links</h2>
		<p>
			A webpage can contain various links that take you directly to other pages and even specific parts of a given page. These links are known as hyperlinks.
			Hyperlinks allow visitors to navigate between Web sites by clicking on words, phrases, and images. Thus you can create hyperlinks using text or images available on a webpage.
		</p>
		<h2>Linking Documents</h2>
		<p>
			A link is specified using HTML tag <b><a></b>. This tag is called�anchor tag�and anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes part of the link and a user can click that part to reach to the linked document. Following is the simple syntax to use <a> tag.
		</p>
			<p id="p01">< a href = "Document URL" ... attributes-list>Link Text< /a>
		</p>
		<p>Example:</p>
			<h2>Linking Documents</h2>
		<p>
			This attribute is used to specify the location where linked document is opened. Following are the possible options -<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<b>_blank</b>:  Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.<br>
			 	<b>_self</b>:  Opens the linked document in the same frame.<br>
			 	<b>_parent</b>:  Opens the linked document in the parent frame.<br>
			 	<b>_top</b>:  Opens the linked document in the full body of the window.<br>
			 	<b>targetframe</b>:  Opens the linked document in a named�targetframe.<br>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Example:</p>
		<h2>Linking to a Page Section</h2>
		<p>You can create a link to a particular section of a given webpage by using�name�attribute. This is a two-step process.</p>
		<p>First create a link to the place where you want to reach with-in a webpage and name it using <a...> tag as follows -</p>
		<p id="p01">HTML Text Links < a name = "top">< /a></p>
		<p>Second step is to create a hyperlink to link the document and place where you want to reach -</p>
		<p id="p01">< a href = "/html/html_text_links.htm#top">Go to the Top< /a></p>
		<p>This will produce following link, where you can click on the link generated�<b> Go to the Top </b>to reach to the top of the HTML Text Link tutorial.</p>
		<p id="p01"><b>Go to the Top</b></p>
		<h2>Setting Link Colors</h2>
		<p>We can set colors of your links, active links and visited links using�link,�alink and�vlink�attributes of < body> tag.</p>
		<p>Example</p>
		<h2>Download Links</h2>
		<p>You can create text link to make your PDF, or DOC or ZIP files downloadable. This is very simple; you just need to give complete URL of the downloadable file as follows -</p>
		<p>Example</p>
		<h1>E-Mail Links</h1>
		<h2>HTML Email Tag</h2>
		<p>
			HTML�<b><a></b>�tag provides you option to specify an email address to send an email. While using <a> tag as an email tag, you will use�mailto: email address�along with�href�attribute. Following is the syntax of using�mailtoinstead of using http.
		</p>
		<p id="p01">< a href = "mailto: abc@example.com">Send Email< /a> </p>
		<p>This code will generate the following link which you can use to send email.</p>
		<p id="p01"><b>Send Email</b></p>
		<p>Now, if a user clicks this link, it launches one Email Client (like Lotus Notes, Outlook Express etc. ) installed on your user's computer. There is another risk to use this option to send email because if user do not have email client installed on their computer then it would not be possible to send email.
		</p>
		<h2>Default Settings</h2>
		<p>You can specify a default�email subject�and�email body�along with your email address. Following is the example to use default subject and body.</p>
		<p id="p01">< a href = "mailto:abc@example.com?subject = Feedback&body = Message">
		Send Feedback< /a> </p>
		<p>This code will generate the following link which you can use to send email.</p>
		<p id="p01"><br>Send Feedback<br></p>
		<h1>Image Links</h1>
		<p>Example</p>
		<p>It's simple to use an image as hyperlink. We just need to use an image inside hyperlink at the place of text as shown below -</p>
		<h2>Mouse-Sensitive Images</h2>
		<p>The HTML and XHTML standards provides a feature that lets you embed many different links inside a single image. You can create different links on the single image based on different coordinates available on the image. Once different links are attached to different coordinates, we can click different parts of the image to open target documents. Such mouse-sensitive images are known as image maps.</p>
		<p>There are two ways to create image maps -</p>
		<ul>
			<p><b>Server-side image maps</b>-This is enabled by the�<b>ismap</b>�attribute of the <img> tag and requires access to a server and related image-map processing applications.<p>
			<p><b>Client-side image maps</b>-This is created with the�<b>usemap</b>�attribute of the <img> tag, along with corresponding < map> and < area> tags.<p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Server-Side Image Maps</h2>
		<p>Here you simply put your image inside a hyper link and use�ismap�attribute which makes it special image and when the user clicks some place within the image, the browser passes the coordinates of the mouse pointer along with the URL specified in the <a> tag to the web server. The server uses the mouse-pointer coordinates to determine which document to deliver back to the browser.
		</p>
		<p>When�ismap�is used, the href attribute of the containing <a> tag must contain the URL of a server application like a cgi or PHP script etc. to process the incoming request based on the passed coordinates.</p>
		<p>The coordinates of the mouse position are screen pixels counted from the upper-left corner of the image, beginning with (0,0). The coordinates, preceded by a question mark, are added to the end of the URL.</p>
		<p>For example, if a user clicks 20 pixels over and 30 pixels down from the upper-left corner of the following image which has been generated by the following code snippet -</p>
		<p>Example-</p>
		<h2>Client-Side Image Maps</h2>
		<p>Client side image maps are enabled by the�<b>usemap</b>�attribute of the <b>< img /></b> tag and defined by special <b>< map></b> and <b>< area></b> extension tags.
		<p>The image that is going to form the map is inserted into the page using the <img /> tag as a normal image, except it carries an extra attribute called�<b>usemap</b>. The value of the usemap attribute is the value which will be used in a <map> tag to link map and image tags. The <map> along with <area> tags define all the image coordinates and corresponding links.</p>
		<p>The <b>< area></b> tag inside the map tag, specifies the shape and the coordinates to define the boundaries of each clickable hotspot available on the image. Here's an example from the image map -
