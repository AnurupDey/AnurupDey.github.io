            <h2>3D Simulation from Scratch - Day 00 - <h3>Setting Everything Up</h3> </h2>
            <p>
                I am about to make a simulation. Now, why make a simulation exactly,
                and what are we going to simulate? <br>
                Well, the origional plan was to create a simulation of the <b>universe</b>, but lets
                see how far I can take it. We might at least make a realistic version of minecraft,
                where blocks don't float in the middle of the sky when blocks bellow them are removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Really, there is no other reason for starting this project than to see how far I can 
                streatch a simulation. I have always wanted to do this, and also have tried to do it 
                a couple times in the past, so I do have some idea of what needs to be done.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am going to document each and every step of the process, so if somebody reading this
                wants to follow along, they can, but it is not meant to be followed along. If you follow 
                this as a tutorial, you will end up going through the same mistakes and potentially
                unneccessary steps that can be avoided that I go through, since I am not a professional 
                and will be learning, potentially from mistakes, as I go along. Either way, I thought it
                would be benefitial if I document the whole process.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the process I will be using is definitely not the easiest way one might go about 
                making a 3D simulation of any sort - in fact, it is deleberately the hardest. There are 
                simpler and quicker ways to do what I want to do, but these other much simpler 
                techniques make things simpler by hiding away the complexities so yo do not have
                to deal with them yourself. I want to know what these complexities are and learn how to
                handle them. My primary objective is to learn from this project as much as possible.
                That is why I choose to write every part of the simulation myself, using no external
                libraries or pre-built tools designed to help make things easier to make simulations 
                - none of that.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I will go through the steps needed to set up everything before I actually jump 
                in and write the code. This does not include planing and deciding on the architecture,
                but things such as setting up the developement environment, getting all the tools ready
                and so on. Here we go!

            </div>
            <p>
                The first thing I need to do is set up the github repository.
